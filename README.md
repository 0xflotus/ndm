###What is this ?

**ndm** is the client _"npm desktop manager"_ app for MacOSX (at the moment).

With ndm you can easily manage your npm and npm packages directly from the couch, without any worries, it is based on the [npmi-cli](https://github.com/npm/npmi-cli) lib and developed over [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with some touch of AngularJS and Sass.

ndm is developed and mantained by [720kb](http://720kb.net)

Feel free to reach us for any info/question, or to support us for the project.

###I love the Shell, why use an app?

Of course, we all love it too.

The Shell command line, is obviously very powerful.

However, not all the people know how to use it sometimes, often can not for intern/office/job reasons, or are not willing to use it.

Forget not that, using an app, does not mean you can no longer use the Command line.
