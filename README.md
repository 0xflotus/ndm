###What is this ?

**ndm** formally _"npm desktop manager"_ is the client GUI for npm (MacOSX only for the moment).

With **ndm** you can easily manage npm and npm packages directly from the couch, without any worries, it is based on the [npmi-cli](https://github.com/npm/npmi-cli) lib and developed over [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with some touch of AngularJS and Sass.

**ndm** is developed and mantained by [720kb](http://720kb.net)

Feel free to reach us for any info/question, or to support us for the project, will be with you.

###I love the Shell, why use an app?

Of course, we all love it too.

The Shell command line, is obviously very powerful.

However, not all the people know how to use it from the scratch.
Sometimes and often, they can not use the Command line for intern/office/job reasons, or are not willing to use it at all.

Forget not that, using an app, does not mean you can no longer use the Command line.

###Installation

###FAQ
**_Is ndm stable?_**

The first releases are not granted to be very stable.

Just give it time, have some patience and, if you would, please contribute by forking, PR and/or creating issues, your help is always appreciated.

**_Do i have to worry about anything when using ndm?_**

Actually not, not really.
ndm does not run any malicious or env/system breaking commands in background.

**_Why is so slow on my pc?_**

ndm speed depends exclusively on your pc/device specs and npm commands speed.
We can't do much to speed up npm commands and charge at the moment.
Wishing npm will be faster in the next releases.
