## About ndm

**ndm** formally _"npm desktop manager"_ is the desktop GUI for [npm](https://npmjs.com/).

With **ndm** you can manage npm, npm projects and npm packages with ease.

**ndm** is built with web technologies, it uses the [npm-cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) - ```require('npm');```- and it is packed up thanks to [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with some touch of AngularJS and Sass.
