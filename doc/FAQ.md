## FAQ

**Is ndm stable?**

The first releases are not guaranteed to be very stable, some problem/bug may happen.

Just give it time, have some patience and, if you would, please contribute by forking, PR and/or creating issues, your help is always appreciated.


**Do i have to worry about anything when using ndm?**

Actually not, not really.
**ndm** does not run any malicious or env/system breaking commands in background, and it doesn't run anything outside of the npm native commands.
If you want to be 100% sure about it, just look at the source code, which is clear and very readable.

**Why is so slow on my pc?**

ndm speed depends exclusively on your pc/device specs and [npm-cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) speed.
We can't do much to speed up your machine or the npm commands.

**Yarn?**

Premise: **ndm** was born several months before Yarn was out.
Yarn is a great tool, we are looking forward to seeing what happens both on the Yarn and the npm side.
Many things could change in the meantime.
That said: if you have any idea or suggestion, here you are welcome to share and discuss!

**Why Mac only?**

We now focus on one OS but the app is developed keeping in mind that it will have to run also on other OSs. We won't _put too much meat on bbq_ for the moment, it is now very important to obtain an OS-abstracted and stable app.

As soon as we are sure that the project is stable, it will be delivered to the other OSs.

**Support?**

Just open an issue, we'll be in touch.
