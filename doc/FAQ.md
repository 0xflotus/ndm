## FAQ

**I use the CLI, why use an app?**

Of course, we all love the npm CLI, no jokes.

It is obviously very powerful.

*ndm* is an alternative experience to the `npmCLI` and here are all the pros:

- Less struggling with long terminal logs, scrolling to find eventual warnings and/or errors.
- All your projects are on the same view, no more multiple `cd` to move from a project to another, just drag them all into the app.
- Notifications (specially when your long long npm install finishes)
- List all your global and local npm installed packages with all the informations you need in one maybe two clicks.
- Cleaner point of view of all your npm projects and dependencies.
- Run npm commands and scripts in one maybe two clicks.
- More features to be finished and to come ...

Also, sometimes we are just lazy and a GUI makes everything more handy.

**Note that:** using **ndm** doesn't mean you can no longer use the CLI.

**Is ndm stable?**

The first releases are not guaranteed to be very stable, some problem/bug may happen.

Just give it time, have some patience and, if you would coome contribute by forking, PR and/or creating issues, your help is always appreciated.


**Do i have to worry about anything when using ndm?**

Actually not, not really.
**ndm** does not run any malicious or env/system breaking commands in background, and it doesn't run anything outside of the npm native commands.
If you want to be 100% sure about it, just look at the source code, which is clear and very readable.

**Why is so slow on my pc?**

ndm speed depends exclusively on your pc/device specs and [npm-cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) speed.
We can't do much to speed up your machine or the npm commands.

**Yarn?**

Premise: **ndm** was born several months before Yarn was out.
Yarn is a great tool, we are looking forward to seeing what happens both on the Yarn and the npm side.
Many things could change in the meantime.
That said: if you have any idea or suggestion, here you are welcome to share and discuss!

**Support?**

Just open an issue, we'll be in touch :ok_hand:
