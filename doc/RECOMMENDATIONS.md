## Recommendations :ok_hand:

- It is highly recommended to install node and npm via brew or nvm or n
- It is highly recommended to not start the app with `sudo` when developing or testing (WRONG! `sudo npm run...`)
- It is recommended to not rename `node_modules/` folder in your projects (which is a standard naming for node pkgs folder)
- It is recommended to manage only versioned projects with ndm (git, svn, mercurial etc..) so that everything can be reverted to it's previous/original status
- It is recommended to install and use always the LTS node version (brew or nvm or n, will help you to manage this with comfort)
- It is highly recommended to fix npm permissions on your machine (if not already fixed) this means you will need no more `sudo`, how to fix them is simple and written here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
- It is recommended to always run the latest version of ndm
