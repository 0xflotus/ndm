## About ndm

### What's ndm ?

**ndm** formally _"npm desktop manager"_ is the desktop GUI for [npm](https://npmjs.com/).

With **ndm** you can manage npm, npm projects and npm packages with ease.

**ndm** is built with web technologies, it uses the [npm-cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) - ```require('npm');```- and it is packed up thanks to [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with some touch of AngularJS and Sass.

### I love the Shell, why use an app?

Of course, we all love it too.

The Shell is obviously very powerful.

We wanted to build an alternative experience to the `npmCLI` and here is all the GUI pros we think you should not miss:

- Less struggling with multiple terminal tabs
- Less struggling with long terminal logs, scrolling to find warnings and errors are a things of the past now
- All your projects are on the same view
- Intuitive interface.
- Notifications (specially when your long long npm install finishes)
- Check npm packages informations with two clicks (such as repository, author, license and so on...)
- Run npm commands and scripts in two clicks

Also, sometimes we are just lazy and a GUI makes it more handy.

**Note that:** using **ndm** doesn't mean you can no longer use the CLI - The power of the Shell is strong! Keep using it, young Padawan! :D
